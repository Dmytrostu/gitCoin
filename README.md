Gitcoin is a cryptocurrency that only requires you and your counter-party to approve changes. We can accomplish this with GitHub Actions. To transact, make a pull-request with you and your counter-party's balance changed in balances.csv

Instead of using a centralized onramp to buy Gitcoin like with other coins, you can transact offline with your counter-party and make you pull-request simultaneously. This really cuts out the middle-man and is 100% tax-free
