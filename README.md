Gitcoin is a cryptocurrency that only requires you and your counter-party to approve changes. We can accomplish this with GitHub Actions. To transact, make a pull-request with you and your counter-party's balance changed in balances.csv

Instead of using a centralized onramp to buy Gitcoin like with other coins, you can transact offline with your counter-party and make your pull-request simultaneously. This really cuts out the middle-man and is 100% tax-free

This is a "first of its kind" currency because only the two parties to the transaction need to approve. In a world of cryptocurrencies designed for the 21st century, take the quantum leap to the 31st century and try Gitcoin
